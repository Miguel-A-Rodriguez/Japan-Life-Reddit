apply margin top to the "join-button" class not the child idiot

Apply flexbox and use it on everything r/japanlife and below

Apply to the second-header a margin: 0 auto; and then change the width, also remove the padding/margin off the image
also change the width to 40% to line it up with everything below.

Try to remove all fixed and apply to the navbar
